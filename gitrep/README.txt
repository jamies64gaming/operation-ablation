hi this game was made by Jamie Clarke

story:
An asteroid belt is heading straight for earth!, you are bieng put in charge of Operation Ablation, this involves you conducting Asteroid laser ablation on all the on coming astroids! the more astroids you ablate, the more reputation you get from the folks at home, meaning the more investors will buy into equipment for you to save the world!
good luck! the world depends on it

instructions:
to run just double click the exe file
to go back to buy menu at any time press r
play again press r
and to shoot is just as easy as clicking where you want to shoot!

notes:
this is the first game im releasing, im doing this more for me and giving myself a boost more than anything, i hope to release more games in the future, although hopefully not python games, as i want them to have alot more content. but i need to start somewhere! everything in the game was made from scratch, sfx, music, art, and code! thank you for playing, even if it was only for a minute. all feedback is welcome, negative and positive, i dont hold a rudge unless you get personal, so try keep it to feedback for the game!


also i know that an error comes up after you close the game, i cant find the source of it, but all files save fine, and thats the last thing to run! if you know the source, or may have an idea why this happens, dont be afraid to comment of the itch.io page!

many thanks,
Jamie
